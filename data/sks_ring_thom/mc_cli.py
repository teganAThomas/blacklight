"""
Shared utilities for generating spectra and images from photon lists

make_spectrum.py and make_image.py take the same input, the lists a run writes, named
<base>.proc<rank>.<output>.list, and treat it the same way: each list is streamed
through in chunks, the ranks of one output are summed, and the outputs are written
separately or averaged over time.  All of that lives here, so that a script supplies
only the function that bins one chunk of photons and the functions that add and write
its results, and the two cannot drift apart.
